### Abstract :book:
* In the big data era, the relationship between entities becomes more complex. Therefore, graph (or network) data attracts increasing research attention for carrying complex relational information. For a myriad of graph mining/learning tasks, graph neural networks (GNNs) have been proven as effective tools for extracting informative node and graph representations, which empowers a broad range of applications such as recommendation, fraud detection, molecule design, and many more. However, real-world scenarios bring pragmatic challenges to GNNs. First, the input graphs are evolving, i.e., the graph structure and node features are time-dependent. Integrating temporal information into the GNNs to enhance their representation power requires additional ingenious designs. Second, the input graphs may be unreliable, noisy, and suboptimal for a variety of downstream graph mining/learning tasks. How could end-users deliberately modify the given graphs (e.g., graph topology and node features) to boost GNNs' utility (e.g., accuracy and robustness)?
* Inspired by the above two kinds of dynamics, in this tutorial, we focus on topics of **natural dynamics** and **artificial dynamics** in GNNs and introduce the related works systematically. After that, we point out some promising but under-explored research problems in the combination of these two dynamics. We hope this tutorial could be beneficial to researchers and practitioners in areas including data mining, machine learning, and general artificial intelligence.
